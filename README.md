# petSwipe-native
This is my first React Native project that serves as a sort of 'playground' as my React Native skills grow. It is centered around a swipable user interface and the concept of finding homes for animals in need of an adoptive family. 

## Technologies Used:
This app communicates with a backend built up from Node.js, PostgreSQL and Knex and integrates some component functionality from the component library "NativeBase".

## Ongoing Work
I plan on implementing Auth once core functionality is complete, through which access and interactivity with the settings page would become available.

Additionally, I plan on integrating in-app messaging for communication between users.
